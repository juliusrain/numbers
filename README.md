Numbers
=======

## Introduction ##
The Russians have kidnapped your father. He is locked in a room that can only be accessed if you know the 6-digit code. Thankfully, their security is really flimsy: once you've entered a code, a "1" is printed for each correct number whose position is correct, and a "0" is printed for each correct number whose position is incorrect. Unfortunately, the Russians know that their security isn't up to par. They've decided that if they can't have your father, nobody can; if you guess incorrectly 12 times, a poisonous gas is released into the room. Quel horreur! Good luck on getting your dad out alive!

## Objective ##
Rescue your father by guessing the secret code! Save our country from the communists!
